## Supported Versions

All versions of SimpleModBot that use discord.js `13` or higher are currently supported. Any versions that use version `12` or lower are not supported anymore due to those versions being depricated and possibly not supporting the current version of the Discord API. 

You can get support in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/49KeKwXc8g).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a bug or security issue in SimpleModBot, please create an [issue](https://github.com/SimpleModBot/SimpleModBot/issues). Before creating an issue, though, please check if your issue has already been found.

### Spamming and Trolls

Anyone who spams or creates a fake issue will be blacklisted from the bot. It wastes our time and we don't appreciate that!!

# SimpleModBot

A bot for Discord I originally made for moderation but grew over time into a multipurpose bot.

The current prefix is `\` but you can change it with the `config` command. You can invite the bot using [this invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=911112976793215006&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

Please read SECURITY.md as it doesn't appear below files like README.md does and it contains other useful information.

**Currently working and pushing alphas for SMB 2.0.**

## Additional information (PLEASE READ ME)

If you wish to use some of my bot code you can, just try to credit me wherever you can. **Nobody** is allowed to obtain a full copy of the project so please stop asking.

*I am hiding some important files because I don't want people to just steal my project entirely or view private information. Sorry for any inconveniences.*

**THIS IS AN ALPHA, I WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MAY OCCUR.**

Most of the data is not that useful or really easy to repair so I do not believe it is worth me trying to get it all back when it occurs.

## Features

- Message commands
- Slash commands
- **Level system
- Developer commands
- Economy system
- Emoji commands
- Fun commands
- Games system
- Image manipulation

*\*Currently disfunctional or disabled. Might get added back/fixed, might not.*

*\*\*Guaranteed to not be coming back on the full release. Is still possible that I add it back in a future update, just unlikely.*

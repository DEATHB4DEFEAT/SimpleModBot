# SimpleModBot

A bot for Discord I originally made for moderation but grew over time into a
multipurpose bot.

Please read SECURITY.md as it doesn't appear below files like README.md does

## Additional Information

If you wish to use my bot code for your project, you can use it, just try to either credit me or change
the code so it isn't obviously stolen.

I am hiding some important files because I don't want people to steal my project entirely. Sorry for any inconveniences.

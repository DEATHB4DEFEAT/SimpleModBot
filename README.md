# SimpleModBot

A bot for Discord I originally made for moderation but grew over time into a multipurpose bot.

The current prefix is `\` but you can change it with the `config` command. You can invite the bot using [this invite link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=911112976793215006&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

Please read SECURITY.md as it doesn't appear below files like README.md does and it contains other useful information.

## Additional information (PLEASE READ ME)

This project is open source **only** so people can contribute and test it easily. I will **not** allow people to claim any of this code as theirs without modification or permission.

Most of the data is not that useful or really easy to repair so I do not believe it is worth me trying to get it all back when it occurs.

*\*Currently disfunctional or disabled. Might get added back/fixed, might not.*

*\*\*Guaranteed to not be coming back on the full release. Is still possible that I add it back in a future update, just unlikely.*

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!

If you are a developer and would like to help with the bot, please join me in the [community server](https://discord.gg/49KeKwXc8g) and tell me how you want to help and why I should trust you. Or join the server just to interact with the community and ask questions!

# SimpleModBot

A bot for Discord I originally made for moderation but grew over time into a
multipurpose bot.

Please read SECURITY.md as it doesn't appear below files like README.md does

## Additional Information

If you wish to use my bots code for your own bot please do not pass it off as
yours and give credit to me wherever you can.

If you want to use the code just download the files as a zip and add your bot
token(s) into the `.env` file where it says, once you have done that go into the
`SimpleModBot/utils` folder and you should see a file called `SMB.bat`,
open the file and you should see the bot online.

*The default prefix is `//` and if you
want the database commands to work you need to put your own MongoDB link.*

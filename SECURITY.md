# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions with a discord.js version 13 or higher are supported until the SMB 2.0 prototypes which are VERY unstable and should not have code copied from. Versions of this bot using discord.js 12 are deprecated and will not function right and soon, not function at all.

---
Once I have finished the prototypes I will update this and the README saying so.

The Prototype will be very unstable and pretty much just backups, I do not reccommend copying any code from this at all.
The Alpha will be somewhat unstable but you can feel free to copy code from it.
The Beta will be as stable as I can make it.
The full release will be 100% stable (on the front end).

You will see some node or git files that are not needed inside of the Prototype/Alpha/Beta builds, just ignore these, they are only for developement.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerabilities, anything that leaks sensitive information (tokens, passwords, etc), dangerous npm packages, or just anything dangerous to the bot.

If you do find something dangerous please join the [community](https://discord.gg/49KeKwXc8g) server and report the issue to me, DEATHB4DEFEAT#1018, and I will try to respond within the next day unless I'm on vacation then it might take longer.

---

If the issue is something **REALLY** dangerous report to me as soon as you possibly can and I will definately reward you and thank you.

If your issue is something dangerous that I don't know of or forgot about you will probably be rewarded in some way for reporting it.

If your issue is something I'm aware of I will tell you that and thank you for worrying about the bot and users safety.

If your issue is just some annoying bug that doesn't affect performance I will thank you for telling me and I will try to fix it.

If your issue isn't important I will decline it and move on.

### IF YOU SPAM OR TROLL

You *will* get blacklisted and no longer be able to use SMB anymore on any accounts that I see trolling. I do not want my time to be wasted by some idiot(s).

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find any vulnerabilities, anything that leaks sensitive information (tokens, passwords, etc), dangerous npm packages, or just anything dangerous to the bot.

If you do find something dangerous please join the [community](https://discord.gg/26NtPVvNCU] server and report the issue to me, DEATHB4DEFEAT#1018, and I will try to respond within the next day unless I'm on vacation then it might take longer.

---

If the issue is something **REALLY** dangerous report to me as soon as you possibly can and I will definately reward tou and thank you.

If your issue is something dangerous that I don't know of or forgot about you will probably be rewarded in some way for reporting it.

If your issue is something I'm aware of I will tell you that and thank you for worrying about the bot and users safety.

If your issue is just some annoying bug that doesn't affect performance I will thank you for telling me and I will try to fix it.

If your issue isn't important I will decline it and move on.

### **IF YOU SPAM OR TROLL**
You *will* get blacklisted and no longer be able to use SMB anymore on any accounts that I see trolling. I do not want my time to be wasted by some idiot(s).

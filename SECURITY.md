# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

All versions with a discord.js version 13 or higher are supported except for the older prototypes. Versions of this bot using discord.js 12 are deprecated and will not function right and soon, not function at all due to the API.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerabilities, anything that leaks sensitive information (tokens, passwords, etc), dangerous npm packages, or just anything dangerous to the bot.

If you do find something dangerous please join the [community](https://discord.gg/49KeKwXc8g) server and report the issue to me, DEATHB4DEFEAT#4404, and I will try to respond within the next day unless I'm on vacation then it might take longer.

---

If the issue is something **REALLY** dangerous report to me as soon as you possibly can and I will definitely reward you and thank you.

If your issue is something dangerous that I don't know of or forgot about you will probably be rewarded in some way for reporting it.

If your issue is something I'm aware of I will tell you that and thank you for worrying about the bot and users safety.

If your issue is just some annoying bug that doesn't affect performance I will thank you for telling me and I will try to fix it.

If your issue isn't important I will decline it and move on.
